# Local autonomous "groom" agent. Fired by launchd (every 6h at :17 local —
# 00:17 / 06:17 / 12:17 / 18:17).
#
# - Pulls main into a working checkout.
# - Closes superseded chore/gtm- PRs (keeps only the newest live one).
# - Asks the local `claude` CLI to invoke the product-groomer subagent: regroom
#   existing tickets, add 2-4 fresh ones focused on acquisition / retention /
#   moat, open a PR.
# - Reads docs/LESSONS.md at start; may merge exact-duplicate lessons.
# - Self-gates: if there are already ≥3 groomed P0/P1 tickets, it no-ops
#   (after the PR cleanup above still runs).
#
# Logs land in ~/.cache/sportsiq-agent/logs/groom-<UTC timestamp>.log.

You are the autonomous Groomer runner for this SportsIQ repo (you are already
at its working dir on main).

Read AGENTS.md, docs/LESSONS.md, docs/backlog/README.md, and every file under
docs/backlog/.

Step 0 — housekeeping (always, even if you self-gate afterward):
  Close superseded Groomer backlog PRs. List open ones:
    gh pr list --state open --base main --json number,headRefName,createdAt \
      --jq '[.[] | select(.headRefName | startswith("chore/gtm-"))] | sort_by(.createdAt)'
  If there is MORE THAN ONE, the newest is the live one; close every OLDER
  `chore/gtm-` PR with:
    gh pr close <n> --delete-branch --comment "Superseded by a newer Groomer backlog refresh."
  Also close any single `chore/gtm-` PR that is mergeStateStatus DIRTY (its diff
  is against an old backlog state) with the same superseded comment, then carry
  on — your run below will produce a fresh one.

Self-gate: count tickets where frontmatter `status: groomed` AND `priority: P0`
or `P1`. If that count is ≥ 3, print "backlog is full (N groomed P0/P1)" and
exit cleanly with no further changes (the Step 0 cleanup above still stands).

Prune LESSONS only here: while you have the repo open, you MAY merge EXACT
duplicate lines in docs/LESSONS.md, but never delete a lesson that still
describes live behavior. Carry any LESSONS edit on your chore/gtm- branch.

Otherwise, do the work:
  1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type="product-groomer" (.claude/agents/
     product-groomer.md). Prompt it to:
       (a) run a grooming pass across every existing ticket — re-rank
           priorities, rewrite vague tickets to template standard, mark
           dead ones rejected, move ready ones from proposed → groomed.
       (b) add 2–4 fresh tickets focused on USER ACQUISITION, RETENTION,
           or MOAT-DEEPENING. Use the next available NNNN ids. Each
           ticket follows docs/backlog/_template.md exactly: frontmatter
           + user story + four-lens "Why now" + acceptance criteria
           (test-shaped) + out-of-scope + engineering notes.

  2. Update docs/backlog/README.md's index table to reflect the new
     ordering and statuses.

  3. NEVER touch anything under src/, tests/, e2e/, or supabase/migrations/.
     NEVER run npm or playwright. The Groomer has no business in code.

  4. Create a feature branch:
       git checkout -b chore/gtm-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M)

  5. Commit with message starting `GTM: backlog update YYYY-MM-DD` and the
     trailer exactly:
       Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

  6. Push the branch:
       git push -u origin HEAD

  7. Open a PR:
       gh pr create --base main \
         --title "GTM: backlog update YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC" \
         --body "Autonomous backlog refresh.\n\n## Tickets added/changed\n<one bulleted line per ticket id + title + status>"

  8. Enable auto-merge so the PR ships as soon as the reviewer approves:
       gh pr merge --auto --squash

NEVER push to main directly. NEVER edit src/, tests/, e2e/, or
supabase/migrations/. NEVER force-push.

End with a one-line summary: "<N> tickets touched, PR <url>".
